<center><h1>Importing Sets</h1></center>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quizlet and StudyStack integration allows you to import sets directly
    from 3rd party websites into
    Stacks. Importing can be done in one of two ways; searching or using the Set ID. </p>

<h3>Importing Sets</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Searching: </b>Type a keyword or a username into the appropriate field and wait for the
        results to load. When the correct set is found, tap the item, and tap "Import Stack". The
        stack will be downloaded (along with any images) and added to your collection.
    </li>
    <li><b>Set ID: </b>Using a browser, navigate to the set. The address of the page will be
        of the format "quizlet.com/xxxxxxx/*set name*" for quizlet sets. xxxxxxx is a number of any
        length, that is
        the Set ID. Input the ID into the Quizlet window and tap "Import Stack".
    </li>
</ul>
