<h3>Learning and Testing</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning and testing modes allow you to review the cards in a flash card
    format. Testing keeps track of right and wrong answers, but otherwise, both are similar.
    Sessions have a timer running on top to let you keep track, which can be paused by tapping.
    Simply tap the check mark or "X" to mark correct or wrong. Swipe to move on. If the session is
    to end early, tap the red X in the top right corner. By default, all testing sessions will be
    enabled to view in Stats.</p>
